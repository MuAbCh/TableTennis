# Ping-Pong
Ping Pong created on the DE1-SOC board (FPGA) using Verilog!

# Overview

This project brings the classic game of Pong to life on the DE1-SoC FPGA board. Taking the traditional Pong gameplay to the next level, we've incorporated exciting features, including dynamic animations, a captivating start screen that leverages on-chip M10K memory, an immersive soundtrack sourced from on-chip memory, and a HEX display and switches implementation for interactive control. The game controls are implemeted via a PS2 keyboard, and we diplayed the game on a VGA monitor. Hope you like it! 

To run the project on your DE1-SoC board, follow these steps:

Clone the repository: git clone https://github.com/muabch/TableTennis.git
Open the project in your Verilog development environment.
Configure the project settings for the DE1-SoC board.
Load the bitstream onto the FPGA.
Power on the DE1-SoC board and start playing!

We utilized the amazing learning material provided by ProjectF and used Rahim Moosa's pong game as a reference.
